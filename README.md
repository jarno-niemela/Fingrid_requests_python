# Wind+Hydrogen storage simulation

A crude s√≠mulation of how big stable output wind power backed by hydrogen power plant could provide in Finland
based on Fingrid open data.

Hydrogen power storage round trip efficiency of 40% based on

NOTE: Do get API key from Fingrid

Data fetching brutally ripped from. This is not a clean fork, do not merge back :)

## Example command and output
```
#Fetch raw data, which is stored in data.json
$ python3 fetch.py

#Run simulation
